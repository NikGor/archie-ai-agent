# Quick Action Button Rules
- Provide 2-3 buttons representing most likely user needs
- Use action-oriented labels (2-4 words)
- **AssistantButton**: triggers follow-up request to assistant
- **FrontendButton**: triggers UI action (navigation, control, etc.)
- Buttons should relate to both text content and widget actions
